            <h3>Little Family Tree, A Genealogy App for Children, Now FREE to Download</h3>
           <p>Herriman, Utah, October 1, 2016</p>
            <p>
                Yellow Fork Technologies LLC has just released a major update to their app, Little
                Family Tree, making it FREE to download through the mobile app stores.  Little Family
                Tree is an app that teaches children about their family history through interactive
                games and activities with information obtained from an online family tree.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today's children intuitively understand how to use touch devices such as smartphones
                and tablets. Little Family Tree brings a child's personal family history to them through
                this learning medium and shares it in a way that is accessible to them. An adult logs
                into an online family tree account, such as FamilySearch, and the app synchronizes the
                data while children play.  There is no need to manually upload or enter family history
                data into the app and any changes made or photos added to the online tree will synchronize
                with the app. The app is read-only and does not change the data on the online tree.
            </p>
            <p>
                Playing Little Family Tree teaches children to: identify family members by name,
                relationship, and picture, understand who and where they come from, and recognize
                and navigate a family tree, all in a fun and engaging way. Most importantly, they
                will feel a connection to their ancestors as they learn about them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Little Family Tree is available for iOS and Android smartphones and tablets and may
                be downloaded directly from the app stores.  The FREE version includes five games;
                five additional games are available in the premium version for $3.99 in the U.S.,
                priced accordingly in other regions. More information, videos, and tutorials can be
                found on the website at <a href="http://www.littlefamilytree.com">http://www.littlefamilytree.com</a>.
